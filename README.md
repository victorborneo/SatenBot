# How to use <h1>
After adding Saten to your server, just use the ;help command.
She'll DM you all the commands you have the privilege to use on that specific server.
If you have any doubts on how to use a command, just use ;help command_here, and
she'll DM you how to use that command in details.

Saten is a work in progress project. At the moment the server cost is higher than how much I make with donations, so I just keep her up because I love the project, and I hope you do too :)
